------------------------------------------
-------------- Star Schema ---------------
------------------------------------------
Structure: A star schema has a central fact table connected to multiple dimension tables. Each dimension table is denormalized and contains redundant data.

Simplicity: Easier to design and understand. Queries are simpler and faster because they involve fewer joins.

Performance: Generally performs better for read-heavy operations and OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) queries.

Use Case: Suitable for simpler data models with fewer relationships and when query performance is a priority.


------------------------------------------
------------ Snowflake Schema ------------
------------------------------------------
Structure: A snowflake schema is a more normalized version of the star schema. Dimension tables are further split into related tables, reducing redundancy.

Complexity: More complex to design and understand. Queries involve more joins, which can impact performance.

Performance: May perform better for write-heavy operations and OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) queries due to reduced redundancy.

Use Case: Suitable for more complex data models with many relationships and when data integrity and storage efficiency are priorities.

Recommendation for Your Run Tracker App
Given that your Run Tracker app will likely involve read-heavy operations (e.g., retrieving user runs, displaying statistics), a star schema might be more suitable. It offers simpler queries and better performance for analytical queries, which are common in tracking and reporting applications.

However, if your app requires complex relationships and you prioritize data integrity and storage efficiency, a snowflake schema could be a better choice.
