full stack run tracker app-ios project
Creating a full-stack Run Tracker app for iOS is an exciting project that involves both front-end and back-end development. Here’s a comprehensive guide to help you get started:

Front-End Development
User Interface (UI):
Design a clean and intuitive UI using React Native.
Create screens for tracking runs, displaying statistics, and user settings.

Map Integration:
Use MapKit to integrate maps and display the user's running route.
Show real-time location updates and route tracking.

GPS Tracking:
Use Core Location to access the device's GPS and track the user's location.
Calculate distance, speed, and duration of the run.

Back-End Development
Server:
Set up a server using Python (Flask/Django).
Handle user authentication, data storage, and API endpoints.

Tracking Metrics:
- HeartRate (BeatsPerMinute) 				            Float		Apple Watch
- BreathingRate | RespiratoryRate (BreathsPerMinute) 	Float		(Not Ready Yet)
- Distance (Kilometers | Meters | Miles) 		        Float		GPS and accelerometer
- Duration (Minutes | Seconds) 				            Float
- Velocity | Speed | Pace 				                Float		GPS and accelerometer
- Track (Indoor | Outdoor)				                Boolean		User Input
- Gender (Male | Female)				                Boolean		User Input
- Age 							                        Int 		User Input
- Terrain (Road | Mountain | Beach | Gym)		        Int		    User Input
- Jobs 							                        Text		User Input
- Name 							                        Text 		User Input
- Date 							                        Datetime


Database:
Use a database (PostgreSQL) to store user data, run history, and statistics.

APIs and Integrations:
Integrate with external APIs for additional features like weather updates or social sharing.
Use RESTful APIs to communicate between the front-end and back-end.

Deployment
Hosting:
Use your owned local computer | server to host your back-end server.
Ensure scalability and reliability.

Security:
Implement security measures to protect user data and ensure secure communication.
Use HTTPS, authentication, and authorization mechanisms.

Technologies
Front-End: JavaScript, React Native Framework
Back-End: Python, Flask Framework
Database: 
    - Firebase
    - PostgreSQL (setup DP flw Supabase) 
Deployment: 
    - Firebase
    - AWS (app hosting) , Supabase (database hosting)
Cybersecurity: skip if host on cloud
Networking: When testing on a physical device, ensure your Flask server is accessible from the device. Use your local network IP address instead of localhost.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tools
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Appwrite: backend, an open-source platform that let u use Auth, Databases, Storage, Functions, Realtime
- Expo: allows us to test our app and run in no time
- NativeWind: it allows us to write tailwind-like style within React Native
