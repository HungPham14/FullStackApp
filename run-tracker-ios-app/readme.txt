full stack run tracker app-ios project
Creating a full-stack Run Tracker app for iOS is an exciting project that involves both front-end and back-end development. Here’s a comprehensive guide to help you get started:

Front-End Development
User Interface (UI):
Design a clean and intuitive UI using Swift and SwiftUI for iOS.
Create screens for tracking runs, displaying statistics, and user settings.

Map Integration:
Use MapKit to integrate maps and display the user's running route.
Show real-time location updates and route tracking.

GPS Tracking:
Use Core Location to access the device's GPS and track the user's location.
Calculate distance, speed, and duration of the run.

Back-End Development
Server:
Set up a server using Node.js, Python (Flask/Django), or any other back-end technology.
Handle user authentication, data storage, and API endpoints.

Tracking Metrics:
- HeartRate (BeatsPerMinute) 				Float		Apple Watch
- BreathingRate | RespiratoryRate (BreathsPerMinute) 	Float		(Not Ready Yet)
- Distance (Kilometers | Meters | Miles) 		Float		GPS and accelerometer
- Duration (Minutes | Seconds) 				Float
- Velocity | Speed | Pace 				Float		GPS and accelerometer
- Track (Indoor | Outdoor)				Boolean		User Input
- Gender (Male | Female)				Boolean		User Input
- Age 							Int 		User Input
- Terrain (Road | Mountain | Beach | Gym)		Int		User Input
- Jobs 							Text		User Input
- Name 							Text 		User Input
- Date 							Datetime


Database:
Use a database (SQL or NoSQL) to store user data, run history, and statistics.
Examples include PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or Firebase.

APIs and Integrations:
Integrate with external APIs for additional features like weather updates or social sharing.
Use RESTful APIs to communicate between the front-end and back-end.

Deployment
Hosting:
Use cloud services like AWS, Google Cloud, or Heroku to host your back-end server.
Ensure scalability and reliability.

Security:
Implement security measures to protect user data and ensure secure communication.
Use HTTPS, authentication, and authorization mechanisms.
